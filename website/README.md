# Website - HandWrite (React)

This is a basic React app skeleton that uses Firebase Auth for login/signup and Firestore for user data.

## Setup
1. Create Firebase project and enable Auth + Firestore + Hosting.
2. Copy Firebase config into `website/src/firebaseConfig.js`
3. `cd website && npm install && npm start`
